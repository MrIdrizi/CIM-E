## Pre-compiled models
This folder contains pre-compiled BNNs and TNNs.
If you are interested in models for a different CPU architecture, just send an e-mail to [me](mailto:rebecca.pelke@rwth-aachen.de).


### Models
The pre-compiled models are named as follows:

`<bnn/tnn>_<datset>_<model name>_b<input batch size>_mxn<m crossbar>x<n crossbar>_inp<input tensor shape>.so`
